            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello! I’m Ronette Domingo, a dedicated Virtual Assistant with strong communication skills, a C2-level English proficiency, and the ability to make clear and effective decisions.
                I’m passionate about delivering exceptional results and am always willing to learn new skills to exceed client expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a self-taught web developer — I designed and built this very website entirely by myself without spending anything. This proves my initiative, resourcefulness, and ability to adapt quickly to new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you’re looking for someone reliable, skilled, and highly motivated to support your business, I’d be excited to work with you and bring value to your projects.
            </p>
